This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  This commonly happens when fetching data from an API and the response is not yet available or is empty.  It can also happen if you're referencing a component before it's mounted or a value that hasn't been initialized.

Example:

```javascript
//In a React Native component:
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData().then(setUser);
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{user.name}</Text> // This will throw an error if user is still null
    </View>
  );
};
```
